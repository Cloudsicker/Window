This summer, I had to stay home due to bad weather and a declining mood. I decided to find something that would cheer me up. I stumbled upon https://www.dreamteamcric.com/aviator-online-exploring-the-history-and-evolution-of-the-classic-flying-game-genre/, and I immediately liked it. It's an Indian resource full of information about flight simulators, their history, and games with bonuses. Reading about various games and the bonuses they offer was incredibly interesting. I like how the site presents information, everything is very accessible and clear.
